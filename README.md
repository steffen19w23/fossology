## About
FOSSology is a open source license compliance software system and toolkit.  As a toolkit you can run license, copyright
and export control scans from the command line.  As a system, a database and web ui are provided to give you a compliance
workflow.  In one click you can generate an SPDX file, or a ReadMe with all the copyrights notices from your software.
FOSSology deduplication means that you can scan an entire distro, rescan a new version, and only the changed files will 
get rescanned.  This is a big time saver for large projects.
